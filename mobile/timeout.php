<!-- Need to program the timeout function which is to login, but if not existent to then goto the login page which allows a new customer.-->

<?php include 'header.php'; 
include zen_href_link(FILENAME_TIME_OUT);
echo zen_href_link(FILENAME_TIME_OUT);

?>

<?php include 'returntodesktop.php' ?>


<?php include 'footer.php'; ?>
